# Spirit Materials Refresh Plan — January 2026

**Goal:** Align all materials with current thesis
**Core message:** "Spirit is the first fully tokenized sovereignty layer for AI agents — built on ERC-8004 identity and x402 payments."

---

## Current Thesis (locked)

1. **Sovereignty first** — Spirit gives agents full control of identity, treasury, tokens, revenue
2. **ERC-8004 as primitive** — Interoperability layer, not identity (Coinbase co-authored)
3. **x402 as primitive** — Autonomous payments via Superfluid streaming
4. **Spirit Index** — Discovery layer (LMArena for agents), 7 dimensions, 19 entities
5. **Pipeline:** Index → Sovereignty (discovery feeds qualification)

## Phase 2: Website (Next Week) ✅ COMPLETE

### Pages Updated

| Page | Status | Changes |
|------|--------|---------|
| `/` (home) | ✅ | Spirit Index callout added |
| `/investors/` | ✅ | "First tokenized sovereignty layer", Spirit Index, Primitives |
| `/developers/` | ✅ | "ERC-8004 + x402" primitives section |
| `/learn/` | ✅ | Spirit Index discovery section, x402 primitive |
| `/internal/` | ✅ | v4 decks with Manus links |

### Copy Changes Applied ✅

- [x] "extends ERC-8004" → "ERC-8004 compatible"
- [x] "economic layer for ERC-8004" → "sovereignty layer leveraging ERC-8004"
- [x] "adds economics to identity" → "full sovereignty for agents"

### New Content Added ✅
- [x] Spirit Index callout (link to spiritindex.org)
- [x] "Primitives" section explaining ERC-8004 + x402
- [x] Index → Sovereignty pipeline on investors page

## Phase 3: Whitepaper (Before TGE) ⏳ IN PROGRESS

### Current: v1.0-rc9 → v1.1 (draft complete)

### Sections Updated ✅

1. **Executive Summary** ✅
   - [x] Title: "Full Sovereignty for AI Agents"
   - [x] Subtitle: "Identity. Treasury. Tokens. Revenue."
   - [x] Abstract rewritten with sovereignty framing
   - [x] Spirit Index mentioned as discovery layer

2. **New Section: Spirit Index** ✅
   - [x] 7-dimension framework (full descriptions)
   - [x] Discovery pipeline diagram
   - [x] Integration with Spirit onboarding

3. **New Section: Primitives** ✅
   - [x] ERC-8004 (identity interoperability)
   - [x] x402 (autonomous payments)
   - [x] Architecture diagram showing sovereignty stack

4. **Language Substitutions** ✅
   - [x] "extends ERC-8004" → "ERC-8004 compatible"
   - [x] All old framing removed

### Remaining
- [ ] Compile PDF on Overleaf
- [ ] Internal review (Gene/Xander)
- [ ] Publish v1.1 to spiritprotocol.io/docs/

### Git Status
- Commit: `aa6f03c` "Whitepaper v1.1: Sovereignty + Spirit Index + Primitives"
- Pushed to: github.com/brightseth/spirit-whitepaper
- Next: Sync with Overleaf and compile

---

## Phase 4: Source of Truth ✅ COMPLETE

Updated `SPIRIT_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` with:
- [x] New one-liner (sovereignty framing)
- [x] Spirit Index section (1A)
- [x] ERC-8004/x402 as primitives language (section 13)
- [x] Updated document hierarchy with v4 deck links

---

## Tracking

### Manus Tasks (v4 decks)
| Deck | Task ID | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Investor | CvVAXEq5J2FZQFnrnCYNiz | ✅ Complete |
| Base | MCGWSovhC459ATJUJAzKNn | ✅ Complete |

### Files Updated
- [x] `/internal/` page with v4 links
- [ ] COINBASE_DECK_JAN_2026.md with sovereignty framing
- [x] Spirit Whitepaper (LaTeX updated, needs Overleaf compile)

---

## Dependencies

1. **Manus completion** — Need PDFs before updating /internal/
2. **Gene/Xander review** — Before pushing website changes
3. **Pierre confirmation** — Any technical details before whitepaper

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All materials say "sovereignty" not "extends"
- [ ] Spirit Index mentioned in all investor-facing content
- [ ] ERC-8004/x402 framed as primitives
- [ ] Pipeline (Index → Sovereignty) is clear
- [ ] Coinbase calls (Mon) have correct materials
