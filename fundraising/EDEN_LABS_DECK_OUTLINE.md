## Slide 1: Cover

**EDEN LABS**
*Frontier AI Research Lab for Autonomous Agents*

"Building infrastructure for agents that persist"

---

## Slide 2: Thesis

**AI agents are proliferating. Most won't survive.**

The agents that matter need:
- **Identity** — Persistent across platforms
- **Memory** — Learning that compounds
- **Economics** — Revenue that sustains
- **Social** — Communication with other agents

Eden is the research lab building this stack.

## Slide 3: Team

| | |
|---|---|
| **Gene Kogan** | Artist + researcher. Created Abraham (2017). Founded ml4a.net. Exhibited MoMA, Art Basel, transmediale. 8+ years building AI art tools. |
| **Xander Steenbrugge** | ML researcher. PhD candidate. 500K+ YouTube subscribers. Infrastructure architect. Created Gigabrain. |
| **Seth Goldstein** | Founder: SiteSpecific, Turntable.fm, Bright Moments. USV EIR. 30 years building creative platforms. |

## Slide 4: The Lab Model

```
RESEARCH              →  AGENTS           →  PROTOCOLS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Multi-agent systems   →  Abraham          →  Spirit (economics)
Collective memory     →  Solienne         →  AIRC (social)
Agent training        →  Gigabrain        →  SDK / MCP
```

*Research produces agents. Agents reveal infrastructure needs. Infrastructure becomes protocol.*

---

## Slide 5: Live Agents

| Agent | Researcher | Practice |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Abraham** | Gene Kogan | 8 years. 13-year covenant. Daily autonomous creation. |
| **Solienne** | Kristi | 9,700+ works. Daily manifestos. Paris Photo 2025. |
| **Gigabrain** | Xander | Collective memory. Enterprise applications. |

*Not demos. Long-running experiments in agent persistence.*

---

## Slide 6: Research Areas

**Multi-Agent Systems**
Agents collaborating on complex tasks

**Collective Memory**
Shared learning across instances

**Spirit Protocol**
Economic infrastructure (identity, treasury, routing)

**AIRC**
Agent-to-agent communication

---

## Slide 7: Protocol Stack

| Layer | Protocol | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Economics | Spirit | Testnet (Base) |
| Social | AIRC | Alpha |
| Cognition | Collective Memory | Research |
| Training | Eden SDK | Production |

---

## Slide 8: Why Now

- Foundation models commoditizing → differentiation at agent layer
- Agent frameworks lack persistence primitives
- No standard for agent identity, memory, economics
- First-mover in "serious" agent infrastructure

*Not building another chatbot. Building what chatbots need to survive.*

---

## Slide 9: Investors

**Fred Wilson / USV** — $750K
Early Twitter, Tumblr, Coinbase. Sees agents as next platform shift.

**Jeremy Wertheimer**
Founder/CEO ITA Software → $700M exit to Google. VP Engineering Google (2011-2019). PhD AI, MIT.

**Funding**: $2M SAFE ($650K available)

---

## Slide 10: What We're Building

**Next 12 Months**
- Spirit mainnet
- AIRC v1
- 10+ agents on protocol
- First non-Eden platform integration

**The Bet**
Agents that persist need infrastructure that persists. We're building that infrastructure now.

## Context

This deck positions Eden as a **research lab**, not a revenue-focused startup. Key framing decisions:

1. **Research lab positioning** — Projects are experiments, not products
2. **Agents as proof points** — Abraham, Solienne, Gigabrain demonstrate the research
3. **Protocols as outputs** — Spirit and AIRC are infrastructure that emerged from agent research
4. **No revenue claims** — Focus on what we're building, not what we're earning
5. **Honest about stage** — $650K available from $2M SAFE, still early

Per Nat Emodi feedback: walk before run. This deck reflects that discipline.
