## INTRO REQUEST TEMPLATE

```
Hey [CONNECTOR],

Quick ask — would you intro me to [INVESTOR]?

Building Spirit Protocol (economic layer for AI agents). We have live agents generating revenue (Abraham ~$5K/week, Solienne $30K at Paris Photo). Raising $2M at $20M FDV, TGE Jan 15.

I'm in NYC Dec 15-20 if they're around.

One-liner they can forward:
"Seth is building Spirit Protocol — tokens and treasuries for AI agents. Live traction, audited contracts, raising a small round before Jan TGE."

Thanks!
```
