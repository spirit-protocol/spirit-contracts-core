# EDEN LABS — Investor Deck v3 (Offense)
**Created**: January 5, 2026
**For**: Strobe call + future investor conversations
**Manus Task**: https://manus.im/app/je3xyeAQ4JMWLDPQBrDNui

## Positioning

**Eden = Frontier AI Agent Lab**

Not a typical startup chasing PMF metrics. We incubate the infrastructure and agents that will matter. Investors pay to stay close because they are confident one or more of these ideas will become important.

**Play offense, not defense. Nothing like numbers to ruin a good story.**

---

## Two Research Differentiators

What distinguishes Eden from all the wrappers:

1. **Collective Memory** — Shared learning across agent instances. Gigabrain is commercializing this.
2. **Multi-Agent Systems** — Agents collaborating on complex tasks. Abraham + Solienne experiments.

## Slide 1: Cover

**EDEN LABS**
*Frontier AI Agent Lab*

"Incubating the agents that will matter"

---

## Slide 2: Thesis

**AI agents are proliferating. Most are wrappers.**

The agents that matter need:
- Persistent identity across platforms
- Memory that compounds across instances
- Economics that sustain long-term operation
- Social protocols to communicate with other agents

Eden is the research lab building this stack — and the agents that prove it works.

---

## Slide 3: Team

**Gene Kogan** — CO-FOUNDER
Pioneer of AI art. Created Abraham (2017) — the first autonomous artificial artist. Founded ml4a.net (Machine Learning for Artists). Achieved many firsts: GAN art, AI video generation, interactive AI installations. Exhibited MoMA, Art Basel, transmediale, Gray Area. Co-founder of Eden and Braindrops.

**Xander Steenbrugge** — CO-FOUNDER
ML researcher and infrastructure architect. 75K+ YouTube subscribers (Arxiv Insights) explaining cutting-edge ML papers. PhD candidate, University of Ghent. Built Eden's entire backend: Eve, ComfyUI pipelines, agent infrastructure. 5 years ML consulting at ML6. Creator of Gigabrain.

**Seth Goldstein** — STRATEGIC LEAD
Three decades building creative platforms across Web 1, 2, and 3. Founded Bright Moments (NFT gallery DAO with galleries in Venice, NYC, Berlin, Tokyo). Co-founded Windward Labs (developing NODE Foundation). Previously: SiteSpecific, Majestic Research. USV Entrepreneur in Residence.

---

## Slide 4: Research That Matters

**What distinguishes Eden from wrappers**

**Collective Memory**
Agents that share what they learn. When one instance discovers something, all instances benefit. Gigabrain is the first commercial application — enterprise AI consulting powered by accumulated knowledge.

**Multi-Agent Systems**
Agents collaborating on complex tasks. Abraham + Solienne coordination experiments. The path to agents that can accomplish more than any single model.

"These are hard problems. We've been working on them for years."

---

## Slide 5: Live Agents

**Abraham** | Gene Kogan
8 years development. 13-year covenant. Daily autonomous creation. The longest-running autonomous AI artist experiment.

**Solienne** | Kristi
9,700+ works. Daily manifestos at 7pm CET. Paris Photo 2025. Fashion consciousness exploring identity through daily practice.

**Gigabrain** | Xander
Collective memory research becoming commercial product. Enterprise consulting. Shared learning across agent instances.

"Not demos. Years of sustained practice."

---

## Slide 6: The Infrastructure

**Eve** (Backend)
Python on Modal. Serverless GPU inference. Production-scale generation. Open source.

**ComfyUI Pipelines**
Production-ready workflows. Community-contributed tools. The engine behind Eden agents.

**Eden SDK**
TypeScript SDK for developers. Task orchestration. Real-time streaming.

**Agent Framework**
Character management. Multi-model routing. Persistent memory. The foundation for autonomous agents.

"Open-source infrastructure for agents that persist."

---

## Slide 7: Protocol Layer

**Spirit Protocol — ready when the agents are**

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Spirit (Economics) | Testnet on Base |
| AIRC (Social) | Alpha |
| Collective Memory | Commercializing via Gigabrain |
| Eden SDK | Production |

Spirit's token model works when 5-10 agents generate consistent revenue. That moment is coming. The infrastructure is ready.

---

## Slide 8: Distribution

**Claude Code as the agentic playground**

- Agents get built in CLIs — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex
- Natural discovery point for Spirit/AIRC/Eden tools
- MCP integration puts our infrastructure where developers already work
- Not competing for attention — embedded in workflow

"Meet developers where they build agents."

---

## Slide 9: Investors

**Fred Wilson / USV** — $750K
Early Twitter, Tumblr, Coinbase. Believes agents are the next platform shift.

**Jeremy Wertheimer**
Founder/CEO ITA Software → $700M exit to Google. VP Engineering Google (2011-2019). PhD AI, MIT.

**The thesis**: Pay to stay close to frontier research. Confident one or more of these ideas will become important.

**Structure**: SAFE → Eden equity + Spirit tokens at protocol launch

---

## Slide 10: The Bet

**Playing offense**

Eden isn't chasing someone else's game.

We're defining the frontier:
- Collective memory that compounds
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Economic infrastructure for agent autonomy
- The agents that prove it all works

**The ask**: Join us in building what comes next.

---

## Strobe Ask

**Target**: $500K+ in SAFE
**Structure**: Eden equity + Spirit tokens at protocol launch
**Bright shiny object**: Claude Code as distribution channel

---

## Key Talking Points

1. **We're not wrappers** — Collective Memory and Multi-Agent Systems are hard problems we've been working on for years
2. **Spirit is early, not wrong** — Works with 5-10 revenue-generating agents, infrastructure is ready
3. **Claude Code distribution** — Natural discovery channel, embedded in developer workflow
4. **Pay to stay close** — Frontier research, confident one or more will pop
5. **Offense, not defense** — Nothing like numbers to ruin a good story
