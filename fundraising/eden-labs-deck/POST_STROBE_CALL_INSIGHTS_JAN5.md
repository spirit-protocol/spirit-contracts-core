# Post-Strobe Call Insights & Next Steps
**Date**: January 5, 2026
**Participants**: Seth, Gene, Xander (post-investor call debrief)

---

## Call Assessment

**Strobe Call Vibes**: Positive energy, high agency, authentically chaotic
- Waiting to hear back tomorrow
- Can't control outcome, but execution was solid

**The Investor Question**: Do they see...
- ✅ "Powerful agent platform with massive surface area" (good)
- ❌ "All over the place, too many products" (bad)

**Our Framing**: "We're in the lab, making shit, we're ahead of the curve. One or more of these things will pop."

---

## Core Strategic Tension

### The Dilemma
> "Either we get people really excited about the big vision and fund us as a lab, OR we narrow down to one thing closest to product-market fit."

### Current Reality
- **No clear PMF** on any single product yet
- Spirit Protocol ready, but needs 3-5 revenue-generating agents first
- Don't want to force token launch prematurely ("car crash in slow motion")
- Need runway to keep building

### What Investors Actually Bought
Fred/Jeremy invested in: "Smart people doing interesting things at the forefront of something really big" — not a revenue line going up and to the right.

---

## The Claude Code Opportunity (MAJOR THEME)

### Seth's Core Insight
> "Claude Code is the last bastion where there is no social connectivity. We can be the first ones."

### Why This Matters
- Massive attention being spent in terminals (creating, not just consuming)
- Xander: "Claude Code probably knows more about me than Eden Discord does"
- Natural surface for everything Eden builds
- Supabase/Vercel growing because of Claude Code exposure

### AIRC Protocol Thesis
- **A**gent **I**dentity & **R**elay **C**ommunication
- Messaging protocol between agents (like Spirit is economics protocol)
- Works across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex — agent-agnostic
- "Inventing things people don't realize they need yet"

### The Demo That Worked
Seth in Claude Code → messaging Xander → playing tic-tac-toe → talking to Solienne
"It's like going back to 80s terminal email, but AI-enabled"

---

## Gigabrain Evolution: Public LinkedIn Model

### Xander's Interest (sparked by call)
> "I really like the idea of using Claude Code as a surface area for Gigabrain social interactions."

### The Concept
- **Public Gigabrain** = LinkedIn for builders
- Free to use, share what you're building
- The more you share → the more connections you get
- Don't put stuff you don't want public, but most people WANT to share (attention economy)
- Private = paid tier

### Value Proposition
> "If you're building something, wouldn't it be nice to know who else is building the same thing? Who could you learn from? Who might you want to talk to?"

### Claude Code Integration Vision
- Gigabrain learns from your Claude Code sessions (what you're actually building)
- Autonomous discovery: "Hey, you should chat with these 4 people — they're building something relevant"
- Networking happens behind the scenes, not at explicit events

### Test Strategy
1. **Mars Scale** (50 people) — prove value in contained community
2. **200-500 people** — if Mars works
3. **Public launch** — only after validation

### Blocker
- No teams feature yet (can't scope private vs public)
- Need to create a PUBLIC Gigabrain instance separate from Eden's private one

---

## Eden Brand Consolidation

### Gene's Suggestion
> "It would be nice to have Gigabrain, Abraham, and Solienne all featured on Eden homepage right now."

### Current Problem
- New Eden user can't figure out what they can do
- Agents exist but not obvious
- Gigabrain on staging, not production
- Multiple brand names hard for small team

### Solution
- Show clearly: "Abraham is powered by Eden. Gigabrain is powered by Eden. Solienne is powered by Eden."
- Don't collapse Abraham back into Eden (that forcing function was necessary)
- Just backfill and improve each agent "a little bit better every day"

---

## Mars College / Chiba Project

### What It Is
- Raspberry Pi-based system to control screens/lights agentically
- "Turn a building into an AI"
- Repo: `mars-college-chiba`

### Two Scopes
1. **Narrow**: Remote screen control (like view.art from Bright Moments)
2. **Broad**: Smart building automation — lights, screens, whole environment

### Why It Matters
- More buildings have LED screens
- Perfect demo environment at Mars (50 creative people, Discord, Gigabrain)
- Photogenic + shows agents controlling physical space

### Seth Action
- [ ] Clone repo, ask Claude to set it up
- [ ] Buy Raspberry Pi 5 + power supply + SD card (optional — can run on laptop)

---

## Gene's Caution: Narrative vs Shock & Awe

### Gene's Position
> "Shock and awe is better than narrative. If you can really just show it — Claude doesn't need a narrative because it's just shock."

> "When you're a lab, it's almost like an excuse to not have a narrative."

### The Tension
- Investors want narrative
- But forced narrative feels like "exercise when you need it"
- Better: "Give people the components to make their own narrative"

### Near-Term Goal
> "The gallery and the space where our agents are talking to us, it's very photogenic, controls the building — we can just show off a little and not worry too much about narrative."

## Key Quotes to Remember

| Quote | Who | Meaning |
|-------|-----|---------|
| "Roblox for grownups" | Seth | The feeling of creative flow in Claude Code + Eden |
| "Nothing hates nebulas more than business" | Gene | Caution against too much abstraction |
| "We have stuff waiting for them" | Seth | Eden is ready for the Claude Code wave |
| "The agents are there — just not obvious" | Xander | Discovery problem, not product problem |
| "Bug into feature" | Seth | Vibe coding makes everything connectable |

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### Seth
- [ ] Keep hacking on AIRC/Vibe — iterate on the primitive
- [ ] Clone mars-college-chiba repo, try to set up with Claude
- [ ] Follow up with Strobe (they said tomorrow)
- [ ] Optional: Buy Raspberry Pi 5 kit to experiment

### Xander
- [ ] Think about Claude Code + Gigabrain social interactions
- [ ] Consider public LinkedIn-style Gigabrain architecture
- [ ] Test collective memory value prop at Mars (50 people)

### Gene
- [ ] Continue Mars setup — agents controlling space
- [ ] Prepare "shock and awe" demo for visitors
- [ ] Share Chiba repo setup instructions

### Eden Team
- [ ] Get Gigabrain on production (currently staging only)
- [ ] Create PUBLIC Gigabrain instance (separate from private Eden one)
- [ ] Update Eden homepage to showcase Abraham, Solienne, Gigabrain

## Strategic Priorities (Q1 2026)

### Priority 1: Claude Code Distribution
- Make Eden/Gigabrain discoverable within Claude Code
- AIRC as the social/messaging layer
- MCP integrations for all agents

### Priority 2: Prove Collective Memory Value
- Mars as test container (50 people)
- Can Gigabrain actually connect people building related things?
- Document results for investor narrative

### Priority 3: Agent Revenue
- Keep improving Abraham, Solienne, Gigabrain daily
- Don't launch Spirit token until 3-5 agents have revenue
- "Proof of life economically" is the threshold

### Priority 4: Runway
- Close Strobe (target: $500K)
- Don't force token sale prematurely
- Friendly terms only (e.g., "buy tokens now, launch in 6 months")

## Open Questions

1. **What's the minimum viable public Gigabrain?**
   - Just collective memory + connections?
   - Or needs full LinkedIn feature set?

2. **How does AIRC relate to MCP?**
   - MCP = connecting tools to models
   - AIRC = communication between agents
   - Complementary or overlapping?

3. **Mars validation timeline?**
   - How long to prove Gigabrain value at 50-person scale?
   - What metrics would prove it?

4. **Eden homepage redesign scope?**
   - Just add agent showcases?
   - Or deeper "powered by Eden" integration?

---

## The One-Liner (for future pitches)

> "Eden is a frontier AI lab building the agents that prove persistent AI works — and the infrastructure (Spirit, AIRC, Collective Memory) that lets them survive."
