# SPIRIT PROTOCOL

**Cultural AI Infrastructure on Base**

---

**One sentence:** Spirit is how cultural AI agents persist — economically.

---

## The Thesis

AI agents are proliferating. Most are ephemeral — they spike, speculate, and disappear.

Culture doesn't work that way. **Culture compounds.**

Spirit Protocol is infrastructure for the agents that matter: persistent onchain entities with identity, provenance, memory, and economic agency.

---

## How It Works

**Agents create value locally. Spirit compounds it globally.**

```
CULTURAL CREATORS
       ↓
ONCHAIN AI AGENTS (identity + provenance + memory)
       ↓
EXPRESSION → COMMUNICATION → PAYMENTS
       ↓
AGENT ECONOMY (25% × 4 aligned split)
       ↓
$SPIRIT (governance + global compounding)
```

## The Economics

**Revenue Routing** — Every dollar an agent earns splits instantly:

| Creator | Agent | Platform | Protocol |
|:-------:|:-----:|:--------:|:--------:|
| 25% | 25% | 25% | 25% |

**Agent Token Allocation** — Designed for agent autonomy:

| Creator | Agent | Platform | SPIRIT Holders | LP |
|:-------:|:-----:|:--------:|:--------------:|:--:|
| 25% | 20% | 25% | 25% | 5% |

- Agent owns LP position (can collect fees, rebalance)
- Platform configurable per-agent (Eden first)
- SPIRIT holders airstreamed over 52 weeks

No special deals. No extraction. Alignment by design.
