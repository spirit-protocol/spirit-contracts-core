## Vesting Schedule

### Key Dates

| Milestone | Date | What Happens |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| **TGE** | January 15, 2026 | Token deployed, LP live, Treasury unlocked |
| **Cliff End** | January 15, 2027 | 20% of vested allocations unlock |
| **Full Vest** | January 15, 2030 | All vesting complete (48 months from TGE) |

### Vesting Mechanics

**For Eden, Team, and Community Upfront (450M total):**
- **Cliff:** 12 months - ZERO tokens unlock before Jan 15, 2027
- **Cliff Release:** 20% unlocks at cliff end
- **Linear Stream:** Remaining 80% streams monthly over 36 months
- **Monthly Rate:** (Allocation × 80%) ÷ 36

**Example - 5M Allocation:**
- Cliff release (Jan 2027): 1,000,000 SPIRIT (20%)
- Monthly stream: ~111,111 SPIRIT/month for 36 months
- Full vest: January 15, 2030

### No-Vesting Allocations

| Bucket | Amount | Mechanism |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Programmatic | 300M | Airstreamed to agents over 4+ years |
| Treasury (operational) | 250M | 1-year linear vest for treasury ops |
| Superfluid Stakers | 5M | Separate 1-year streaming program |

---

## Agent Token Economics

Each AI agent launched through Spirit Protocol has its own token (1B supply per agent).

### Agent Token Distribution (Per Agent)

| Allocation | Amount | % | Notes |
|------------|--------|---|-------|
| Uniswap LP | 250M | 25% | Tradeable immediately |
| Airstream to SPIRIT holders | 250M | 25% | Streamed over 52 weeks |
| Artist | 250M | 25% | Locked 52 weeks |
| Agent Wallet | 250M | 25% | Locked 52 weeks |
| **TOTAL** | **1,000M** | **100%** | |

### The Flywheel

```
Hold SPIRIT → Receive child tokens when agents launch →
Stake child tokens → Earn more SPIRIT → Repeat
```

### Staking Multiplier

- **Range:** 1× to 36×
- **Mechanics:** Longer stake duration = higher multiplier
- **Max multiplier requires:** Maximum lock period

---

## Governance

### Phase 1: Launch (Months 0-12)
- **2-of-3 Multisig:** Seth, Gene, Fred (or delegate)
- Fast execution for ecosystem bootstrapping
- Sub-$25K spends approved by founders
- Monthly treasury reports published onchain

### Phase 2: Hybrid (Months 12-24)
- Token holder voting for major decisions
- Large expenditures (>$250K) require token votes
- Snapshot voting + onchain execution

### Phase 3: Full DAO (Month 24+)
- Complete community governance
- All treasury spending via proposals
- Onchain governance with time-locks

---

## Legal Structure

**Entity:** Spirit Protocol Association
**Type:** Wyoming Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA)

### What SPIRIT Is
- Governance token for protocol stewardship
- Used to propose and vote on protocol decisions
- Coordinates treasury allocation, agent onboarding, platform approvals

### What SPIRIT Is NOT
- NOT equity or ownership in any company
- NOT a security or investment contract
- NOT entitlement to dividends, royalties, or revenue share
- NOT a claim on profits from others' efforts
