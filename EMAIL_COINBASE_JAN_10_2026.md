# Email Draft: Coinbase Pre-Call Materials (v2)

**To:** Nick Shaheen, Hoolie Tejwani
**CC:** Clay Maffett, Gene Kogan, Xander Steenbrugge
**Subject:** Updated Spirit materials ahead of Monday calls

---

Hi Nick, Hoolie —

Looking forward to connecting Monday. Sharing updated materials that reflect where we've landed architecturally.

**The core thesis:** Spirit provides full sovereignty for AI agents — identity, treasury, tokens, and revenue they control. Not platforms controlling agents, but agents controlling themselves.

**What's evolved since early January:**

1. **Architecture locked** — Synced with Superfluid (Pierre) this week. Self-service agent creation via x402 streaming payments. Backend validates, contracts execute. Clean separation.

2. **Spirit Index live** — [spiritindex.org](https://spiritindex.org) — Think LMArena, but for cultural agents instead of LLMs. 7-dimension scoring framework (Persistence, Autonomy, Cultural Impact, etc.). 19 entities indexed. This becomes the discovery and evaluation layer for which agents qualify for Spirit sovereignty.

3. **ERC-8004 compatible** — Spirit implements the ERC-8004 interfaces (the agent standard Coinbase co-authored). Not chasing the standard — just ensuring interoperability as the ecosystem matures.

**Updated decks:**

- [Base Partnership Deck (PDF)](https://spiritprotocol.io/docs/internal/Spirit_Coinbase_Deck_Jan2026.pdf)
- [Investor Deck (PPTX)](https://spiritprotocol.io/docs/internal/Spirit_Investor_Deck_Jan2026.pptx)
- [All internal docs](https://spiritprotocol.io/internal/)
- [Spirit Index](https://spiritindex.org) — Live benchmark

**Quick reference:**
- Total supply: 1B SPIRIT on Base
- Revenue split: 25/25/25/25 (Artist/Agent/Platform/Protocol) — hardcoded, no negotiation
- Genesis agents: Abraham, Solienne, Gigabrain — live today, generating revenue
- Current round: $2M at $20M FDV

See you Monday.

Best,
Seth
