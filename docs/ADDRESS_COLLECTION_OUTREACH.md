Hey [NAME],

Quick update on Spirit Protocol — we're preparing for TGE on January 15, 2026.

You have a [AMOUNT] SPIRIT allocation as a [CATEGORY]. To receive your tokens, we need your Base network wallet address.

**Two options to submit:**

1. **Quick form** (if you know your details):
   https://spiritprotocol.io/community-allocation/

2. **Guided experience** (if you want to learn about the protocol):
   https://spiritprotocol.io/onboard/

   This walks you through the tokenomics, vesting schedule, and flywheel before collecting your wallet.

**Your allocation details:**
- Amount: [AMOUNT] SPIRIT
- Cliff: January 15, 2027 (12 months after TGE)
- Cliff release: 20% ([CLIFF_AMOUNT] SPIRIT)
- Full vest: January 15, 2030 (48 months total)
- Monthly stream after cliff: ~[MONTHLY] SPIRIT/month

**Deadline**: December 29, 2025

Let me know if you have questions. The onboard flow also has a Spirit AI agent that can answer tokenomics questions.

Best,
Seth
