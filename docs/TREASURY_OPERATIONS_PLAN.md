## 1. OTC Sales (110M SPIRIT)

### Purpose
Large private sales to strategic investors, DAOs, or ecosystem partners who want meaningful positions without market impact.

### Decisions Needed

**Price per SPIRIT**:
- [ ] Fixed price: $_____ per SPIRIT
- [ ] FDV-based: $_____M FDV ÷ 1B = $_____ per SPIRIT
- [ ] Negotiated per deal

**Suggested**: $0.04/SPIRIT ($20M FDV) — matches presale if same pricing

**Minimum Purchase**:
- [ ] $10,000 minimum (250K SPIRIT at $0.04)
- [ ] $25,000 minimum (625K SPIRIT at $0.04)
- [ ] $50,000 minimum (1.25M SPIRIT at $0.04)
- [ ] No minimum (case-by-case)

**Maximum Purchase**:
- [ ] 10M SPIRIT per buyer (~$400K at $0.04)
- [ ] 25M SPIRIT per buyer (~$1M at $0.04)
- [ ] No cap (full 110M available)

**KYC Requirements**:
- [ ] Full KYC required (ID, proof of address, source of funds)
- [ ] Light KYC (ID + email only)
- [ ] No KYC (anonymous purchases)
- [ ] KYC for >$X amount only

**Vesting for OTC Buyers**:
- [ ] No vesting (immediate liquidity)
- [ ] 6-month lockup
- [ ] 12-month cliff + 12-month linear (2 years total)
- [ ] Same as team vesting (12m cliff + 36m linear)
- [ ] Negotiated per deal

**Suggested**: 12-month lockup, then liquid — aligns with team cliff but allows exit sooner

### OTC Process

1. Investor expresses interest (email/intro)
2. Seth/Gene review fit (strategic value, not just capital)
3. Term sheet sent (price, amount, vesting, KYC)
4. KYC completed (if required)
5. Payment received (USDC/ETH to treasury)
6. SPIRIT transferred (after TGE)
7. Vesting contract created (if vesting required)

### Target OTC Buyers

| Category | Examples | Fit |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Crypto DAOs | Gitcoin, ENS, etc. | High - ecosystem alignment |
| AI/Crypto VCs | Variant, a]6z Crypto, etc. | Medium - depends on terms |
| Strategic Partners | Superfluid, Base ecosystem | High - already involved |
| High-Net-Worth Collectors | Known to team | Medium - case by case |

## 2. Presale (50M SPIRIT)

### Purpose
Smaller public/semi-public sale for community members and supporters who want early access before TGE.

### Decisions Needed

**Platform**:
- [ ] Direct sale (treasury receives USDC/ETH, sends SPIRIT)
- [ ] Juicebox (decentralized crowdfunding)
- [ ] Fjord Foundry / Copper Launch (fair launch platforms)
- [ ] Simple website with wallet connect

**Suggested**: Simple website or direct sale — Spirit Protocol is not a "launch" project, more curated

**Price**:
- [ ] Same as OTC: $0.04/SPIRIT ($20M FDV)
- [ ] Discount to OTC: $0.03/SPIRIT ($30M FDV)
- [ ] Premium to OTC: $0.05/SPIRIT ($50M FDV)

**Suggested**: Same as OTC ($0.04) — simpler, fairer

**Cap per Wallet**:
- [ ] 100K SPIRIT max (~$4K at $0.04)
- [ ] 500K SPIRIT max (~$20K at $0.04)
- [ ] 1M SPIRIT max (~$40K at $0.04)
- [ ] No cap

**Suggested**: 500K SPIRIT per wallet — prevents whale dominance while allowing meaningful positions

**Whitelist/Access**:
- [ ] Open to anyone
- [ ] Whitelist only (curated list)
- [ ] Braindrops/Bright Moments holders priority
- [ ] Eden users priority

**Suggested**: Whitelist with priority for Braindrops/Bright Moments holders — they get first 24h, then opens

**Timeline**:
- [ ] Before TGE (Dec 2025 - Jan 14, 2026)
- [ ] At TGE (Jan 15, 2026)
- [ ] After TGE (week of Jan 15+)

**Suggested**: Before TGE (Jan 1-14) — creates demand, known supply entering market

**Vesting**:
- [ ] No vesting (immediate at TGE)
- [ ] 3-month lockup
- [ ] 6-month lockup
- [ ] 12-month linear vest

**Suggested**: No vesting — presale buyers are smaller holders, liquidity helps price discovery

---

## 3. Aerodrome Ignition (10M SPIRIT)

### Purpose
Bootstrap liquidity on Aerodrome (Base's main DEX) in addition to Uniswap V4.

### Decisions Needed

**Pool Type**:
- [ ] SPIRIT/ETH concentrated liquidity
- [ ] SPIRIT/USDC stable pair
- [ ] SPIRIT/AERO gauge (earn AERO emissions)

**Timing**:
- [ ] At TGE (day 1 liquidity)
- [ ] Week 1 post-TGE
- [ ] After price discovery (week 2+)

**Suggested**: Week 1 post-TGE — let Uniswap V4 establish price first

### Action Items
- [ ] Contact Aerodrome team about ignition program
- [ ] Understand gauge requirements
- [ ] Coordinate timing with TGE

---

## 4. Braindrops Holders (10M SPIRIT)

### Purpose
Reward early Eden/Braindrops NFT holders with SPIRIT allocation.

### Decisions Needed

**Snapshot Date**:
- [ ] Historical date (already past): _______
- [ ] Dec 31, 2025 (pre-TGE)

**Distribution per Holder**:

**Claim Mechanism**:

- [ ] Direct airdrop (sent to wallets)
- [ ] Superfluid stream (over time)

**Suggested**: Merkle drop — cheaper, forces engagement

**Expiration**:

- [ ] 90 days to claim

## Questions for Seth

1. Do these suggested parameters look right?
2. Any OTC conversations already in progress?
3. Preference on presale platform?
4. Braindrops/Bright Moments snapshot — do you have historical data, or need to pull fresh?
