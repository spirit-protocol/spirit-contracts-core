# SPIRIT Token Distribution System

This system is built on Solidity smart contracts and leverages Uniswap liquidity pools to create a decentralized token distribution mechanism. The core architecture centers around a **Swapper Router** contract that manages SPIRIT token acquisition and distribution. The router can swap for SPIRIT tokens and distribute them to child token stakers (like Abraham), while also interacting with a central SPIRIT/ETH liquidity pool. An NFT auction module accepts USDC input and contributes additional SPIRIT rewards to the staking pools, creating multiple revenue streams for token holders.

The system utilizes interconnected Uniswap liquidity pools to facilitate token swaps and provide liquidity for the SPIRIT ecosystem. The central SPIRIT/ETH pool serves as the primary trading pair, with bidirectional connections to specialized pools for each child token (ABRAHAM/SPIRIT, SOLINNE/SPIRIT, CITIZEN_BOT/SPIRIT, etc.). Each child token comes with its own complete set of components: a token contract, liquidity pool, and staking pool. Child token stakers receive streamed rewards from both the Swapper Router and NFT auction proceeds, creating a sustainable token distribution model that incentivizes long-term participation through continuous reward streaming.
