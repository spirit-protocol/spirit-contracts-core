# SPIRIT PROTOCOL — SOURCE OF TRUTH

**Last Updated:** December 19, 2025 @ 8:00pm PST
**Updated By:** Seth (via Claude.ai)
**Status:** LOCKED unless noted
**Next Review:** After Shan (Coinbase) feedback

---

## QUICK REFERENCE

**One sentence:** Spirit is how cultural AI agents persist — economically.

**Token split (Agent):** 25% Creator / 25% Agent / 25% Platform / 25% SPIRIT Holders

**Revenue split:** 25% Creator / 25% Agent / 25% Platform / 25% Protocol (hardcoded)

**TGE:** Q1 2026 (public) / January 15, 2026 (internal)

**Genesis Agents:** Abraham, Solienne, Gigabrain (NO Geppetto)

---

## 1. CORE IDENTITY

**Thesis:**
> AI agents are proliferating. Most are ephemeral — they spike, speculate, and disappear. Culture doesn't work that way. Culture compounds. Spirit is infrastructure for the agents that matter.

**Positioning Decision:** Lead with CULTURAL frame (not infrastructure)
- Abraham's 13-year covenant is unique
- Infrastructure can be replicated; culture can't
- Differentiation from Virtuals, ai16z, etc.

## 2. $SPIRIT TOKEN (LOCKED)

| Parameter | Value | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Total Supply | 1,000,000,000 | LOCKED |
| Network | Base (Coinbase L2) | LOCKED |
| TGE (Public) | Q1 2026 | USE THIS |
| TGE (Internal) | January 15, 2026 | INTERNAL ONLY |

### Allocation

| Category | % | Amount | Vesting | Notes |
|----------|---|--------|---------|-------|
| Community Programmatic | 30% | 300M | Airstreamed to agents | |
| Treasury | 25% | 250M | Governed by holders | NOT distributed |
| Eden Incubation | 25% | 250M | 48mo vest, 12mo cliff | |
| Protocol Team | 10% | 100M | 48mo vest, 12mo cliff | |
| Community Upfront | 10% | 100M | Genesis artists, advisors | |

---

## 3. AGENT TOKEN DISTRIBUTION (LOCKED)

**Confirmed:** Pierre (Superfluid), December 19, 2025

| Recipient | % | Amount | Notes |
|-----------|---|--------|-------|
| Creator/Artist | 25% | 250M | Auto-staked 52 weeks |
| Agent | 25% | 250M | 20% staked + 5% seeds liquidity |
| Platform | 25% | 250M | Eden first 10, opens later |
| SPIRIT Holders | 25% | 250M | Airstreamed 52 weeks via merkleRoot |

**Public framing:** "25% × 4" — LP is implementation detail within Agent's 25%

---

## 4. REVENUE ROUTING (HARDCODED)

| Recipient | % |
|-----------|---|
| Creator/Artist | 25% |
| Agent Wallet | 25% |
| Platform | 25% |
| Protocol (staking pool) | 25% |

**Justification (for Coinbase):**
- Artist 25%: Lifetime compensation for training (industry-leading)
- Agent 25%: Operational costs (compute, storage, inference)
- Platform 25%: Standard marketplace fee (comparable to galleries)
- Treasury 25%: Protocol sustainability (NOT distributed to holders)

**Critical:** Treasury is GOVERNED by holders, NOT DISTRIBUTED to holders.

---

## 5. STAKING MECHANICS (LOCKED)

### How It Works
- Stake AGENT tokens (e.g., $ABRAHAM, $SOLIENNE)
- Receive SPIRIT as governance incentive (NOT "rewards")
- Longer lock = higher multiplier

### Multiplier Scale

| Lock Period | Multiplier |
|-------------|------------|
| 1 week | 1x |
| 52 weeks | 12x |
| 156 weeks | 36x |

### What Holders Get vs. Don't Get

| ✅ GET | ❌ DON'T GET |
|--------|--------------|
| Agent token airstreams (pro-rata) | Direct revenue distribution |
| Governance over protocol | Dividends or profit sharing |
| Governance over treasury | Guaranteed returns |
| | Equity in any entity |

---

## 6. SECURITIES LANGUAGE (MANDATORY)

### Required Substitutions

| ❌ Never Say | ✅ Always Say |
|--------------|---------------|
| "Earn rewards" | "Receive governance tokens" |
| "Earn SPIRIT" | "Receive SPIRIT for participation" |
| "Revenue share" | "Operational allocation" |
| "Profit distribution" | "Protocol incentives" |
| "Value capture" | "Ecosystem alignment" |
| "Yield" | "Governance weight" |
| "Investment" | "Participation" |
| "Jan 15, 2026" (public) | "Q1 2026" |
| "DEX trading begins" | "Protocol operations begin" |

### Key Legal Points
1. SPIRIT = governance token, not investment contract
2. Staking = active participation, not passive income
3. Treasury = governed by holders, not distributed to holders
4. Legal structure = Wyoming DUNA (nonprofit)
5. Counsel = Aaron Wright
